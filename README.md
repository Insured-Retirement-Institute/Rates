# Rate APIs

The goal is to establish industry-wide standards for rate APIs used in the annuity market, enabling consistent, secure and efficient transmission of product rates between carriers, distributors and third-party vendors.  Standardizing these APIs will reduce operational friction, improve data accuracy, shorten product update cycles, and enhance the experience for financial professionals and customers.

The initial focus will be on four rate API scenarios:
1.	**New Issue Rates**- Rates for new contracts shared at a product level (e.g., fixed interest rate, RILA/FIA cap and step rates, etc.).
2.	**Renewal Rates** – Renewal rates for existing products approaching renewal shared at a product level
3.	**Contract-Specific Renewal Rates** – renewal rates for a specific contract based on that contracts product, state, issue date, renewal date, etc.
4.	**Feature Specific / Rider Rates** – Rates for new contracts, shared at a product level, that apply to features or riders.  
a.	As an example, the client has the option to elect a GWBL rider and the current accumulation rate is 6% and the current withdrawal rate is 7%.

## The Problems these APIs will solve
Currently, the industry lacks a common standard for transmitting rate updates across carriers, distributors, and technology providers.  This creates multiple challenges:
•	Inefficiency – Each carrier uses proprietary formats and processes, requiring duplicative integration work for each distributor or vendor
•	Data inconsistency – Rates may be delayed, miscommunicated, or entered incorrectly, leading to compliance risks and potential loss of sales.
•	Slower Speed to Market – New or updated rates may take days to propagate across platforms, delaying the ability to present competitive offerings to clients.
•	Higher Cost – Maintaining multiple custom integrations strains IT and operations budgets.
Without industry standards, rate distribution will remain fragmented, creating unnecessary costs, errors, and time delays for all parties.
